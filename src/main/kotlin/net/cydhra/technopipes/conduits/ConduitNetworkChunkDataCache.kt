 * indicate this invariant to be broken, but there is no definite check for the validity of this invariant. When a
 * chunk is being loaded, its data should be removed from this cache. If a chunk is being loaded and there is no data
 * of it in this cache, the chunk has just been generated and does not have any conduit network data assigned.
